### Selling MKR to cover system debt

A debt auction is the process in which the Maker Protocol auctions freshly minted MKR tokens for DAI in order to cover debt that has built up in the system, sometimes referred to as ‘Unbacked Dai’. The Dai that is used to buy the MKR will be burned by the Maker Protocol, reducing the Dai Supply. 

### How does the bidding work?

The debt auctions follow what is referred to as a ‘Reverse Auction’. This means that you bid a fixed amount of Dai, in this case 10,000, for decreasing amounts of MKR. For example, if the current bid is 50 MKR, or a price of 200 DAI/MKR, your next bid would need to be less than 50 MKR. The mechanics of the auction also force you to bid in at least 3% increments, so in this example, the next possible bid would be 48.5MKR, or 206.19 DAI/MKR. Please note that bidding does incur gas fees, and the final cost will be dependant on the gas price you select.
